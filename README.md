### Business Problem

Recenly , the organisation has noticed an increase in customers who are leaving the organisation and would like to understand why this is happening as well as identify customers who are likely to churn in order to engage and retain those customers. As there is substantial costs involved with reaching customers, the organisation is interested in curating a list of customers to share with its marketing team to begin the engagement process.

### Problem Statement

### Data Science Activities
